# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build/Run Commands
- Install: `npm install`
- Dev (both frontend & backend): `npm run dev`
- Dev frontend only: `npm run dev:frontend`
- Dev backend only: `npm run dev:backend`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Preview: `npm run preview`

## Authentication Setup
The application uses Clerk for authentication. To set up authentication:

1. Create a Clerk account at https://dashboard.clerk.com/
2. Create a new application 
3. Copy the Publishable Key from your Clerk dashboard
4. In `.env.local`, uncomment and set:
   ```
   VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_actual_key_here
   ```
5. Configure Clerk webhook for Convex user synchronization (optional for development)

**Current Status**: Authentication system is fully functional with Clerk integration, including complete Instagram OAuth support.

### Social OAuth Providers
To enable social login options:

#### Quick Setup (Clerk Dashboard Only)
1. **Google OAuth**:
   - Go to Clerk Dashboard â†’ SSO Connections
   - Enable Google provider
   - Configure OAuth credentials from Google Cloud Console

2. **Facebook OAuth**:
   - Go to Clerk Dashboard â†’ SSO Connections  
   - Enable Facebook provider
   - Configure OAuth credentials from Facebook Developer Console

#### Instagram OAuth (Custom Implementation)
Instagram login requires a custom OAuth proxy service since Instagram is not natively supported by Clerk.

**Important Update (2024)**: Instagram Basic Display API was deprecated on December 4, 2024. Now using Instagram API with Instagram Login.

1. **Requirements**:
   - Users must have Instagram Business or Creator accounts (not personal)
   - No Facebook Page connection required

2. **Create Instagram App**:
   - Go to Meta Developer Console (developers.facebook.com)
   - Add "Instagram API with Instagram Login" product
   - Configure OAuth redirect URIs for your proxy service
   - Request scopes: `instagram_business_basic`, `instagram_business_content_publish`

3. **Deploy Proxy Service** âœ… **COMPLETED**:
   - Cloudflare Worker deployed at `rite-instagram-oauth-proxy.sehyunchung.workers.dev`
   - Transforms Instagram OAuth to OIDC format for Clerk compatibility
   - Handles both login and dashboard connection flows
   - Validates Business/Creator account requirement
   - Maps user data (username, user_id, account_type, profile_picture_url)

4. **Configure in Clerk** âœ… **COMPLETED**:
   - Custom OIDC provider configured with key: `instagram`
   - Strategy name: `oauth_custom_instagram`
   - Discovery URL: `https://rite-instagram-oauth-proxy.sehyunchung.workers.dev/.well-known/openid-configuration`
   - Attribute mapping configured for Instagram fields

5. **Integration Status** âœ… **FULLY WORKING**:
   - Instagram login through Clerk OAuth âœ…
   - Instagram connection for content publishing âœ…
   - Connection data saved to Convex database âœ…
   - Dashboard displays connected account status âœ…

**Note**: The new API provides better features for content publishing and requires Business/Creator accounts.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

This project is configured with Kibo UI MCP server for AI-assisted development:
- **Configuration**: `.claude.json` in project root
- **Capabilities**: Claude Code can access Kibo UI component documentation
- **Benefits**: Real-time component recommendations and usage guidance

### Development Setup
- Run `npm run predev` to initialize Convex development environment and open dashboard
- Use `npm run dev` to start both frontend (Vite) and backend (Convex) in parallel
- Convex dashboard automatically opens for database management
- Frontend serves at localhost with auto-reload
- MCP integration provides AI-assisted component development

## Code Style Guidelines
- Formatting: Follow Prettier defaults, 2-space indentation
- Imports: Group and sort imports (React/Next, external, internal, types)
- Types: Use TypeScript strictly, avoid `any` types and non-null assertions
- Naming: Use PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables/functions
- Styling: Use Tailwind CSS for styling with shadcn/ui design tokens
- Components: 
  - Prefer functional components with hooks
  - Use shadcn/ui components for basic UI elements
  - Use Kibo UI for advanced functionality (file uploads, QR codes, etc.)
- Error handling: Use try/catch with appropriate logging
- State management: Use React Context for global state, hooks for local state
- Comments: Document complex logic, avoid obvious comments

## Deployment Recommendations

### Recommended Platform: Vercel
**Why Vercel:**
- Zero-config deployment for Vite + TanStack Router
- Excellent Asia/Pacific edge network (critical for Korean users)
- Automatic GitHub deployments on push to main
- Simple environment variable management for Clerk/Convex keys
- Generous free tier (100GB bandwidth, perfect for MVP phase)

### Alternative Options:
1. **Netlify** - Similar features, slightly slower in Asia
2. **Cloudflare Pages** - Fast globally, more complex setup
3. **Railway** - Good for full-stack apps, overkill for frontend

### Deployment Setup:
1. Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Add custom domain: rite.party
3. Set environment variables:
   - `VITE_CONVEX_URL`
   - `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - `VITE_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL`
   - `VITE_INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID`
   - `VITE_INSTAGRAM_OAUTH_PROXY_URL`
4. Deploy settings:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Install Command: `npm install`
5. Enable automatic deployments for main branch

### Performance Optimization:
- Vercel automatically handles:
  - Client-side routing for TanStack Router
  - Asset optimization and CDN distribution
  - HTTPS certificates
  - Compression (gzip/brotli)
- Consider adding Korean CDN endpoints when scaling

## Instagram OAuth Proxy

The Instagram OAuth integration uses a custom Cloudflare Workers proxy to bridge Instagram's OAuth 2.0 with Clerk's OIDC requirements.

### Architecture
- **Proxy Service**: Deployed at `rite-instagram-oauth-proxy.sehyunchung.workers.dev`
- **Framework**: Hono.js on Cloudflare Workers
- **Purpose**: Transform Instagram OAuth to OIDC format for Clerk compatibility

### Key Features
- âœ… **Dual Flow Support**: Handles both login (via Clerk) and dashboard connection flows
- âœ… **JWT Token Generation**: Creates proper OIDC-compatible ID tokens
- âœ… **State Management**: Preserves OAuth state for security and flow routing
- âœ… **Business Account Validation**: Ensures only Business/Creator accounts can connect
- âœ… **Convex Integration**: Saves connection data to database with proper authentication

### API Endpoints
- `GET /.well-known/openid-configuration` - OIDC discovery for Clerk
- `GET /oauth/authorize` - Instagram authorization initiation
- `GET /oauth/callback` - Instagram OAuth callback handler
- `POST /oauth/token` - Token exchange for OIDC compatibility
- `GET /oauth/userinfo` - User information endpoint for Clerk

### Environment Variables (Cloudflare Workers)
- `INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID` - Instagram app client ID
- `INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_SECRET` - Instagram app client secret
- `RITE_APP_URL` - Main application URL for redirects

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
cd instagram-oauth-proxy && npx wrangler deploy

# Set secrets
npx wrangler secret put INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID
npx wrangler secret put INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_SECRET  
npx wrangler secret put RITE_APP_URL
```
