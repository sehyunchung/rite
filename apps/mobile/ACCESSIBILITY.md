# Mobile App Accessibility Implementation

This document outlines the accessibility improvements implemented for the RITE mobile app.

## Accessibility Features Implemented

### Navigation and Routing

- **Tab Navigation**: Added proper `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityHint`, and `accessibilityRole` for all tab items
- **Tab Icons**: Screen reader friendly labels and hints for navigation icons
- **HapticTab Component**: Enhanced with `accessibilityRole="tab"` and proper state management
- **Navigation State**: Tab selection state properly communicated to assistive technologies

### Form Accessibility

- **Input Fields**: All form inputs now include:
  - `accessibilityLabel` for field identification
  - `accessibilityHint` for field purpose explanation
  - `accessibilityRequired` for required field indication
  - `accessibilityRole="text"` for proper element identification
- **Button Components**: Enhanced with:
  - Automatic accessibility labels from button text
  - Custom accessibility hints for button actions
  - Disabled state properly communicated
  - Loading/busy states for async operations
- **Date Picker**: Accessible date selection with proper labeling

### Interactive Elements

- **Buttons**: All buttons now include proper ARIA-like attributes:
  - `accessibilityRole="button"`
  - `accessibilityState` for disabled/busy states
  - Descriptive labels and hints
- **TouchableOpacity**: Enhanced with proper roles and labels throughout the app
- **Loading States**: Proper `accessibilityRole="progressbar"` for loading indicators

### Semantic Structure

- **Headers and Sections**: Proper semantic roles for content organization:
  - `accessibilityRole="header"` for main headings
  - `accessibilityRole="main"` for main content areas
  - `accessibilityRole="region"` for distinct sections
- **Lists**: Event lists properly marked with `accessibilityRole="list"` and items as `accessibilityRole="listitem"`
- **Text Content**: Descriptive labels for important text content

### Screen Reader Support

- **Content Descriptions**: Meaningful descriptions for all interactive elements
- **Navigation Context**: Users can understand their location and available actions
- **State Communication**: Loading, disabled, and error states are properly announced
- **List Navigation**: Event lists provide proper context about position and total items

## Implementation Details

### UI Component Updates

1. **Button Component** (`@rite/ui/button.native.tsx`):
   - Added accessibility props to interface
   - Automatic accessibility labeling
   - Proper state management for screen readers

2. **Input Component** (`@rite/ui/input.native.tsx`):
   - Enhanced with accessibility role and properties
   - Support for required field indication
   - Proper keyboard type and text entry configuration

3. **HapticTab Component**:
   - Added tab role and state management
   - Maintained haptic feedback functionality

### Screen-Level Improvements

1. **Authentication Screen** (`auth.tsx`):
   - Header section with proper semantic role
   - Authentication options grouped logically
   - Button states clearly communicated

2. **Dashboard Screen** (`index.tsx`):
   - Main content area properly identified
   - Event lists with proper list semantics
   - Loading states accessible

3. **Create Event Screen** (`create.tsx`):
   - Form structure with proper field labeling
   - Submit button with proper state communication
   - Date picker with accessible interaction

4. **Tab Layout** (`_layout.tsx`):
   - All tabs with descriptive labels and hints
   - Test IDs for automated testing
   - Proper icon labeling

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing

1. **Screen Reader Testing**:
   - Test with TalkBack (Android) and VoiceOver (iOS)
   - Verify all interactive elements are properly announced
   - Check navigation flow and context awareness

2. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - Ensure all interactive elements are reachable
   - Verify proper focus management
   - Test tab order and navigation

3. **High Contrast Testing**:
   - Verify text readability with system high contrast modes
   - Check color contrast ratios meet WCAG guidelines

### Automated Testing

1. **Accessibility Linting**:
   - Use ESLint accessibility rules
   - React Native accessibility testing tools
   - Static analysis for accessibility issues

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test with accessibility testing frameworks
   - Verify proper announcement of dynamic content
   - Check focus management in navigation flows

## WCAG 2.1 Compliance

### Level A Compliance

✅ **1.1.1 Non-text Content**: All icons and images have proper alternative text
✅ **1.3.1 Info and Relationships**: Proper semantic structure and roles
✅ **1.4.1 Use of Color**: Information not conveyed by color alone
✅ **2.1.1 Keyboard**: All functionality available via keyboard/switch control
✅ **2.4.1 Bypass Blocks**: Navigation structure allows bypassing repeated content
✅ **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value**: All UI components have proper names and roles

### Level AA Considerations

✅ **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)**: Text contrast meets minimum requirements with dark theme
✅ **2.4.3 Focus Order**: Focus order is logical and intuitive
✅ **3.2.1 On Focus**: No context changes on focus alone
✅ **3.3.2 Labels or Instructions**: Form inputs have proper labels and instructions

## Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements

1. **Voice Commands**: Integration with system voice control
2. **Gesture Alternatives**: Alternative navigation methods for users with motor impairments
3. **Customizable Text Size**: Support for dynamic text sizing
4. **Reduced Motion**: Respect user preferences for reduced motion
5. **Error Handling**: Enhanced accessibility for form validation errors

### Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Regular Audits**: Schedule periodic accessibility reviews
2. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback from users with disabilities
3. **Team Training**: Ensure development team understands accessibility requirements
4. **Documentation Updates**: Keep accessibility documentation current with app changes
