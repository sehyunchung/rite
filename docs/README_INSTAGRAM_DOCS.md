- **Korean Market Focus**: Seoul electronic music scene, not worldwide expansion
- **Honest Pricing**: â‚©15-30K/month (~$11-22), not enterprise tiers

## ðŸ’° **Realistic Business Model**

### Pricing Strategy
**Free Tier**: Generate 2 posts per month, basic templates
**Premium Tier (â‚©20,000/month ~$15)**: Unlimited posts, all templates, direct posting

### Conservative Projections
```
Year 1 Goals:
- 20-30 total active users
- 5-10 premium subscribers
- â‚©100K-200K/month revenue (~$75-150)

Year 2 Potential:
- 50-80 total users through referrals
- 15-25 premium subscribers  
- â‚©300K-500K/month revenue (~$225-375)

Success Definition:
- Sustainable tool that covers its own costs
- DJ friends actually find it useful and recommend it
- Positive contribution to Korean electronic music scene
```

### Why This Model Works
- **No friction**: Full functionality available to try before paying
- **Fair pricing**: Less than cost of one freelance designer per event
- **Real value**: Paying for convenience, not basic functionality
- **Korean market**: Pricing appropriate for local scene economics

## ðŸ›  **Technical Requirements (Simplified)**

### Development Approach
- **4-week iterations** with friend feedback at each step
- **Quality over features**: Better to have 3 great templates than 10 mediocre ones
- **Korean-first design**: Typography, aesthetics, cultural considerations
- **Progressive enhancement**: Add features only after validating core value

### Technology Stack (Already In Place)
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (already working)
- **Backend**: Convex (already set up)
- **Image Generation**: Canvas API for template rendering
- **File Storage**: Convex file storage (already available)
- **Authentication**: Existing Clerk integration

### Success Metrics (Usage Over Revenue)
- **Content Quality**: Friends rate generated posts 7/10+ for "professional appearance"
- **Usage Rate**: 70%+ of generated posts actually get posted to Instagram  
- **Time Savings**: Self-reported 30+ minutes saved per event
- **Referral Growth**: New users from existing user recommendations

## ðŸš¦ **Risk Assessment (Honest)**

### High-Probability Risks
**1. Generated Content Looks Amateur (60% chance)**
- *Risk*: Templates feel generic, friends don't want to use them
- *Mitigation*: Professional designer input, extensive friend feedback
- *Plan B*: Focus on manual tools that help with layout/fonts

**2. Korean Market Too Small (40% chance)**  
- *Risk*: Not enough organizers to sustain even modest revenue
- *Mitigation*: Expand to other Asian scenes if Korean market validates
- *Plan B*: Pivot to general event management or different feature focus

**3. Instagram Preference for Manual Control (50% chance)**
- *Risk*: DJs prefer hands-on creative control over automation
- *Mitigation*: Start with generation tools, add automation only if requested
- *Plan B*: Focus on layout assistance rather than full automation

### What We're Not Worried About
- **Technical feasibility**: Straightforward implementation with proven stack
- **User problem validation**: Observed pain points in friend network
- **Competition**: Building for specific community, not global scale
