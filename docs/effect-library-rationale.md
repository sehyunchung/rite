# Effect Library Integration Rationale

## Why Effect?

The Effect library was chosen for the RITE platform's file upload system after careful consideration of the specific challenges in handling file uploads across web and mobile platforms.

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Type-Safe Error Handling**

Effect provides compile-time guarantees about error handling through its tagged error system:

```typescript
// Traditional approach - errors are untyped and can be missed
async function uploadFile(file: File): Promise<Result> {
  // Errors thrown are not tracked by TypeScript
  if (file.size > MAX_SIZE) throw new Error('File too large');
  // ...
}

// Effect approach - all errors are typed and must be handled
const uploadFile = (file: File) =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    if (file.size > MAX_SIZE) {
      return yield* Effect.fail(
        new FileTooLargeError({
          fileName: file.name,
          fileSize: file.size,
          maxSize: MAX_SIZE,
        })
      );
    }
    // TypeScript knows this can fail with FileTooLargeError
  });
```

### 2. **Composable Retry Logic**

Built-in retry strategies that are composable and configurable:

```typescript
// Exponential backoff with jitter for network requests
const retryPolicy = Schedule.exponential('100 millis')
  .pipe(Schedule.jittered)
  .pipe(Schedule.compose(Schedule.recurs(3)));

// Apply to any Effect
const uploadWithRetry = uploadFile(file).pipe(Effect.retry(retryPolicy));
```

### 3. **Concurrent Operations with Fine Control**

Upload multiple files with precise concurrency control:

```typescript
// Upload 2 files at a time (optimal for mobile networks)
// Continue even if some fail
const uploadEffect = Effect.all(files.map(uploadFile), {
  concurrency: 2,
  mode: 'either', // Collect both successes and failures
});
```

### 4. **Progress Tracking Architecture**

Effect's streaming capabilities enable real progress tracking (when platform supports it):

```typescript
const uploadStream = Stream.fromIterable(files)
  .pipe(Stream.mapEffect(uploadFile, { concurrency: 2 }))
  .pipe(Stream.tap((result) => updateProgress(result)));
```

### 5. **Resource Management**

Automatic cleanup of resources (network connections, file handles):

```typescript
const uploadWithCleanup = Effect.acquireUseRelease(
  openFileHandle(file),
  (handle) => uploadData(handle),
  (handle) => closeHandle(handle) // Always runs, even on error
);
```

## Trade-offs Acknowledged

### Complexity

- **Learning Curve**: Team members need to understand Effect's functional programming concepts
- **Debugging**: Stack traces can be more complex than traditional async/await
- **Bundle Size**: Adds ~50KB gzipped to the bundle

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Progressive Adoption**: Effect is isolated to complex async operations (file uploads)
2. **Helper Functions**: Provided `formatUploadError` to simplify error handling for consumers
3. **Documentation**: This document and inline comments explain the patterns
4. **Type Safety**: The type system guides correct usage

## Real-World Benefits in RITE

### Mobile Upload Resilience

```typescript
// Handles flaky mobile networks gracefully
const uploadFile = (file: SelectedFile) =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    // Validate file
    yield* validateFileEffect(file);

    // Get upload URL with retry
    const uploadUrl = yield* Effect.retry(
      generateUploadUrl(file),
      Schedule.exponential('1 second')
    );

    // Upload with timeout and retry
    yield* uploadToStorage(uploadUrl, file).pipe(
      Effect.timeout('30 seconds'),
      Effect.retry(retryPolicy)
    );
  });
```

### Error Recovery and User Feedback

```typescript
// Users get specific, actionable error messages
const result = await Runtime.runPromise(effectRuntime)(uploadEffect);

if (Effect.isFailure(result)) {
  const error = result.cause.failure;

  switch (error._tag) {
    case 'FileTooLargeError':
      Alert.alert(
        `File ${error.fileName} is too large. Max size: ${formatFileSize(error.maxSize)}`
      );
      break;
    case 'InvalidFileTypeError':
      Alert.alert(`File type ${error.fileType} is not supported`);
      break;
    case 'UploadNetworkError':
      Alert.alert(`Network error uploading ${error.fileName}. Please try again.`);
      break;
  }
}
```

### Testability

Effect's pure functional approach makes testing deterministic:

```typescript
// Tests are predictable and don't require mocking
describe('uploadFile', () => {
  it('should fail with FileTooLargeError for oversized files', async () => {
    const largeFile = { size: MAX_FILE_SIZE + 1, name: 'test.jpg' };
    const result = await Runtime.runPromise(testRuntime)(uploadFile(largeFile));

    expect(Effect.isFailure(result)).toBe(true);
    expect(result.cause.failure._tag).toBe('FileTooLargeError');
  });
});
```

## When to Use Effect

### Good Use Cases

- Complex async workflows (file uploads, API orchestration)
- Operations requiring retry logic
- Concurrent operations with precise control
- Error handling that needs to be exhaustive
- Resource management (file handles, connections)

### When to Keep It Simple

- Simple synchronous operations
- Basic CRUD operations
- UI state management (use React state)
- Simple data transformations

## Migration Path

For teams new to Effect:

1. **Start Small**: Use Effect for new, isolated features (like file upload)
2. **Learn Patterns**: Focus on `Effect.gen`, `Effect.tryPromise`, and `Effect.all`
3. **Gradual Adoption**: Convert complex async operations one at a time
4. **Share Knowledge**: Document patterns and create team guidelines

## Conclusion

Effect provides significant value for complex async operations like file uploads, where:

- Network reliability is uncertain (mobile networks)
- Error handling must be comprehensive
- Concurrency control is critical
- Retry logic is necessary
- Type safety prevents runtime errors

The complexity trade-off is justified by the robustness and maintainability gains, especially for mission-critical features like file uploads in a production DJ event platform.
