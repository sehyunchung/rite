# Customer Validation Plan: Instagram Automation
## Talking to Friends Before Building Features

---

## üéØ **Validation Goals**

**Primary Question:** Do our DJ organizer friends actually want Instagram automation enough to pay ‚Ç©15,000-30,000/month for it?

**Secondary Questions:**
- How much time does Instagram posting actually take per event?
- What parts of the process are most annoying?
- What would generated content need to look like to be usable?
- What price point feels reasonable for the time saved?

## ‚úÖ **Validation Success Criteria**

### Go/No-Go Thresholds

**Strong Go Signal (Build Full MVP):**
- 70%+ report Instagram promotion takes 2+ hours per event
- 60%+ willing to pay ‚Ç©20,000+ per month
- 80%+ interested in beta testing
- Consistent pain points across user segments

**Weak Go Signal (Build Minimal Test):**
- 50%+ report 1+ hour per event on Instagram
- 40%+ willing to pay ‚Ç©15,000+ per month  
- 60%+ interested in beta testing
- Some pain points but mixed feedback

**No-Go Signal (Don't Build):**
- <40% see significant time savings value
- <30% willing to pay ‚Ç©15,000+ per month
- <50% interested in beta testing
- No consistent pain points identified

### Pivot Signals
**If interviews reveal different priorities:**
- Analytics more important than automation
- Templates more valuable than full automation
- Scheduling more important than content generation
- Price sensitivity requires freemium model

---

## üîç **Follow-up Research**

### If Validation is Positive
**Deeper Dives:**
1. **Design Research:** Show mockups of generated posts for quality feedback
2. **Competitor Analysis:** What tools do they currently use and why?
3. **Workflow Analysis:** Map detailed current process to identify automation points
4. **Pricing Research:** Test specific price points with value propositions

### Beta Recruitment Strategy
**From Interviews:**
- Follow up with "yes" responses for beta signup
- Ask for referrals to similar organizers
- Get permission to contact again with prototype

**Beta Group Composition:**
- 10-15 total testers
- Mix of user types and event frequencies
- Include both Rite users and non-users
- Geographic spread across Seoul/Korea

---

## üìã **Interview Logistics**

### Contact Method
- **Existing Rite users:** In-app message + KakaoTalk
- **Non-users:** Direct KakaoTalk or introduction through mutual friends
- **Backup:** Instagram DM if no other contact method

### Interview Format
- **Preferred:** In-person coffee/casual setting (30% better response rate)
- **Alternative:** KakaoTalk video call
- **Backup:** Voice call or detailed message exchange

### Incentives

## üìä **Analysis Framework**

### Quantitative Analysis
```python
# Simple analysis structure
validation_metrics = {
    'time_spent_hours': [], # Per event
    'current_monthly_spend': [], # In KRW
    'willingness_to_pay': [], # In KRW
    'event_frequency': [], # Events per year
    'beta_interest': [], # Boolean
}

# Calculate averages and distributions
avg_time = mean(time_spent_hours)
avg_spend = mean(current_monthly_spend)  
avg_wtp = mean(willingness_to_pay)
beta_rate = sum(beta_interest) / len(beta_interest)
```

### Qualitative Analysis
**Pain Point Frequency:**
- Count mentions of each pain point type
- Identify most common workflow bottlenecks
- Map pain intensity vs user type

**Feature Request Analysis:**
- Categorize requested features
- Prioritize by frequency and user type
- Identify must-have vs nice-to-have

**Quote Collection:**
- Compelling quotes for each major pain point
- User descriptions of ideal solution
- Pricing justification explanations

## üéØ **Decision Framework**

### After All Interviews Complete

**Recommendation Structure:**
1. **Executive Summary:** Go/No-Go recommendation with confidence level
2. **User Insights:** Key findings about pain points and workflows  
3. **Market Validation:** Pricing and demand validation results
4. **Feature Prioritization:** What to build first based on feedback
5. **Beta Plan:** How to recruit and structure beta testing
6. **Risk Assessment:** What could still go wrong despite validation

**Decision Options:**
- **Full Go:** Build complete MVP as planned
- **Modified Go:** Build simplified version based on feedback
- **Test Go:** Build minimal prototype for further validation
- **Pivot:** Build different feature that addresses revealed needs
- **No Go:** Focus development effort elsewhere

**Timeline:**
- Complete interviews: 3 weeks
- Analysis and decision: 1 week
- Beta recruitment (if go): 1 week
- MVP development start: 5 weeks from today

## üí° **Success Indicators**

**Great Validation Session:**
- User immediately understands the value proposition
- Shares specific examples of time wasted on Instagram
- Asks follow-up questions about features
- Volunteers to beta test without being asked
- Suggests price point without prompting

**Poor Validation Session:**
- User doesn't see the problem as significant
- Says they "might" use it but seems uncertain
- Price sensitivity too high for sustainable business
- Prefers manual control over automation
- No enthusiasm for beta testing

**Perfect Quote Examples:**
- "I spend 3 hours making graphics for each event and I hate it"
- "‚Ç©30,000 is less than I pay my designer for one event"
- "If it looked professional I would definitely use this"
- "Can you build this faster? I have an event next month"

Remember: We're looking for strong, consistent signals across multiple users, not just polite interest.
