# RITE: Product Vision & Strategy
## Building for Friends, Not Metrics

---

## üéØ **Core Mission**

**What We're Actually Building:** A simple, reliable event management tool for Korean DJ organizers that saves them time and makes their lives easier.

**Why We're Building It:** Because our friends in the electronic music scene spend too much time on tedious event logistics when they'd rather focus on the music and community.

**Success Metric:** People actually use it regularly and say it makes their event management less annoying.

## üéµ **Product Philosophy**

### Building for Real People
- **Friends First**: Start with actual DJ organizers we know, not imaginary market segments
- **Real Problems**: Solve genuine pain points, not invented ones from market research
- **Authentic Value**: Create tools people genuinely want to use, not features that sound good in pitches

### Honest Business Approach
- **Sustainable, Not Scalable**: Aim for helpful tool used by Korean scene, not global domination
- **Value Before Revenue**: Build something useful first, worry about money later
- **Realistic Expectations**: 50 happy users > 1000 frustrated ones

### Technical Excellence
- **Reliability Over Features**: Core functionality must work perfectly
- **Simple Over Clever**: Clear, intuitive interfaces over impressive complexity
- **Responsive Architecture**: Real-time capabilities that match the live music industry pace
